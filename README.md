# **Big-O-Demo Tutorial**

**Big O Java Tutorial Type Up Learning**

Just a demo tutorial we did in class.

I added some colors to the line graph chart. 

I also learned that by right-clicking on the line graph chart itself when you run the LineGraphChart.java you can change the colors and few other things in there as well as save a .png of the line graph.

The picture below is just an example of me changing the colors in the LineGraphChart.java.
